Data types:

the main purpose of datatype it allocates a particular amount of memory space.
in main memory for the respected value and it also identifies what type of value 
we need to store in that variable.
data types classified into three types
->primitive
->non primitive
->user defined
primitive: we can able to store only one value in a single variable but not more.
 ex: int x=10;
primitive datatypes are again subclassified into 4 
->int, float, char, Boolean
int:- category datatype we can able to store only numerical values and we have the dates
lines byte, short, int, long
float:-we can store decimal values
char:-we can store single character. Specify to char with single quote
